# Pokémon Cry Guesser App

This project implements [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and the [wavesurfer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wavesurfer/react) library to run a simple guessing game. Listen to the audio cry and guess which Pokémon makes the sound!

This project is intended to showcase my front-end development skills in React, and is not in any way monetized. Pokémon and Pokémon character names are trademarks of Nintendo.

## Play on GitHub Pages:
